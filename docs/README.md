|FEATURES|
=Resident Registration: Register residents with duplicate ID detection and input validation
=Payment Simulation: Process payments with custom exception handling
=Statistical Reporting: Console dashboard showing transaction totals and resident count
=Sorting Engine: Sort residents alphabetically by last name using Comparator
=Search/Filter: Search residents by last name using Java Streams

## How to Compile and Run
COMPILE PROGRAM == "javac -d out $(find src -name "*.java")"
RUN PROGRAM == "java -cp out com.barangay.ui.Main"


||OOP CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED IN THE PROJECT||
**Encapsulation** — All fields private with validated getters/setters
**Inheritance** — `PaymentService` and `ResidentService` extend abstract `BarangayService`
**Polymorphism** — Interface overriding (`Payment`, `Reportable`), method overloading (`registerResident`)
**Abstraction** — Abstract class `BarangayService`, interfaces `Payment` and `Reportable`
**Generics** — `Repository<T>` utility class
**Streams & Lambdas** — Used in filtering and sorting collections
**Custom Exception** — `ExceptionHandling` used across all service layers
